### V9 - A Simple JavaScript Engine

V9 is a project aimed at building a simple JavaScript engine that understands the JavaScript programming language. The goal is to create a basic interpreter for JavaScript, and eventually, we aspire to add more advanced features than the current V8 engine, taking it to the next level.

#### Motivation

The motivation behind V9 is to provide a learning experience for those interested in understanding how a JavaScript engine works internally. By building a simple interpreter, developers can gain insights into lexing, parsing, and interpreting JavaScript code. The project aims to be a beginner-friendly resource for studying language interpreters and compilers.

#### Features

The initial version of V9 will focus on the following core features:

1. Lexical Analysis (Tokenization): Tokenizing the input JavaScript code into meaningful tokens to be consumed by the parser.

2. Syntax Analysis (Parsing): Building an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens to represent the structure of the JavaScript code.

3. Interpretation: Evaluating the AST to execute the JavaScript code step by step.

#### Future Enhancements

Once the basic interpreter is functional, we plan to expand the capabilities of V9 with additional features. Some potential enhancements include:

- Function Inlining: Optimizing the performance of function calls through inlining.

- Memory Management: Implementing a garbage collector to manage memory efficiently.

- Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: Exploring JIT compilation techniques for improved execution speed.

- ECMAScript Compliance: Striving to achieve higher compatibility with the ECMAScript standard.

#### How to Contribute
